# Contributing

## Branch naming
- Make seperate branches for your tasks assigned so they can be Peer Reviewed. 
- In cases where multiple people need to work back and forth on the same piece or pieces of code together, a single branch can be created


## Commit messages
- Write meaningful messages during commits.

## Pull requests
- Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the main branch before creating a pull request.
- Provide a clear and concise description of the changes in the pull request so we can keep track of what changes are made and when.
- Also be sure to resolve any merge conflicts before submitting the pull request.

## Testing
- Always be sure to test your code thoroughly before committing changes.
- Add new tests for features or fixes when applicable, unless there are other plans for more thorough tests at a later point.
- Ensure all existing tests pass before creating a pull request.
